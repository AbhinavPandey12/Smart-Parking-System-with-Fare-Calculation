This project was developed to facilitate parking and to promote hassle free driving. Its
main purpose is to monitor and signalize the state of availability of every single
parking slot in the parking lot. Additionally, the project is also capable of providing a
proper fare calculation technique depending on the time the vehicle has been parked
in the provided slot.
